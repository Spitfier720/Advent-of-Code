# Advent-of-Code
A collection of all the solutions to the Advent of Code problems.

I'm told that companies look at this, and I desperately hope that's true because I've spent a lot of time on this.

If you somehow managed to find your way here, you're welcome to compare your solutions with mine, or copy them if you want(but there's a bit of shame in that, isn't there?)

You'll notice that my commit messages have nothing to do with the code. Instead, they are my little reflections on the problem, since the commits are only made when the problems are solved.

[THIS REPOSITORY IS A WORK IN PROGRESS, POSSIBLY FOREVER]
